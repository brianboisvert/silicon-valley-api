# README

* This is a backend Rails API built to render character data from the hit HBO show, Silicon Valley.

* All data is generated at random using the Faker Gem, found in the gemfile. Note that every time you seed,
  the data is randomized and will therefore will change between seeds

* Some individual character info (name and gif if character) is manually generated in the seed file. That will remain constant.

* Run bundle install and a local Rails server to get started

* front end app rendering of this data can be found in this repo: https://github.com/yassimortensen/silicon-valley-react-frontend
